# Lipid_Droplets

This repositery contains files allowing the simulation and analysis of lipid droplet systems as described in this paper [1] :

Bacle A., Gautier R., Jackson C.L., Fuchs P.F.J., Vanni S. (2017)
Interdigitation between core triglycerides and surface phospholipids modulates the surface properties of lipid droplets.
Biophysical Journal, 112, 1417-1430. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2017.02.032)

## Content

The different directories contain the following:

- `pure_TO`: a box of 108 trioleins (TO or tri-C18:1).
- `LD204`: a typical system mimimicking a lipid droplet consisting of an oily phase of 204 TO sandwiched between two POPC monolayers of 100 lipids surounded by water.
- `analysis`: a script `tabouret.py` allowing the analysis of TO conformations. This script is written in Python 2 and requires the modules [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [mdtraj](https://mdtraj.org).

These two systems correspond to the entries `pureTO` and `LD0` in table 1 of ref. [1].

## Force field

The POPC parameters (`popc.itp`) come from the Berger force field [2]. The TO parameters (`triolein.itp`) were adapted from Berger by Vattulainen and co-workers [3]. Typically, starting from a POPC molecule, the sn-3 was replaced by an oleoyl chain. For all oleoyl chains both in POPC and TO, a correction on the double bond [4] was applied. All the systems were simulated with GROMACS 4 [6].

If you use these files, please cite Bacle et al. (2017) [1] and Hall et al. (2008) [3].

We kindly thank Ilpo Vattulainen for sharing the triolein parameters.
